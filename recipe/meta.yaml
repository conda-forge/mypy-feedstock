  summary: Optional static typing for Python
  description: |
    Add type annotations to your Python programs, and use mypy to type check
    them. Mypy is essentially a Python linter on steroids, and it can catch
    many programming errors by analyzing your program, withoutactually having
    to run it.  Mypy has a powerful type system with features such as type
    inference, gradual typing, generics and union types.
