      summary: Mypyc compiles Python modules to C extensions. It uses standard Python type hints to generate fast code.
      description: |
        The compiled language is a strict, gradually typed Python variant. It
        restricts the use of some dynamic Python features to gain performance,
        but it's mostly compatible with standard Python.

        Mypyc uses mypy to perform type checking and type inference. Most type
        system features in the stdlib typing module are supported.

        Compiled modules can import arbitrary Python modules and third-party
        libraries. You can compile anything from a single performance-critical
        module to your entire codebase. You can run the modules you compile also
        as normal, interpreted Python modules.

        Existing code with type annotations is often 1.5x to 5x faster when
        compiled. Code tuned for mypyc can be 5x to 10x faster.

        Mypyc currently aims to speed up non-numeric code, such as server
        applications. Mypyc is also used to compile itself (and mypy).

  summary: Optional static typing for Python
  description: |
    Add type annotations to your Python programs, and use mypy to type check
    them. Mypy is essentially a Python linter on steroids, and it can catch
    many programming errors by analyzing your program, without actually having
    to run it.  Mypy has a powerful type system with features such as type
    inference, gradual typing, generics and union types.
